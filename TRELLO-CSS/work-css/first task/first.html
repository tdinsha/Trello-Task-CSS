  <h1>Futura Labs</h1>
  <p style="background-image: url('pic.jpg'); color: blue; text-align: justify;">Lorem ipsum, sometimes called "lipsum," is a form of placeholder text that mimics the natural visual flow of content in a space. The phrase "lorem ipsum" derives from 
    the Latin phrase "dolorem ipsum," which translates to "pain itself." Lorem ipsum text often appears to readers as a segment of Latin text, but the text actually 
    uses a scrambled mixture of Latin elements and made-up words or phases. The placeholder text meaningless, and designers in print and digital industries use it as 
    it allows them to focus on the design of the project instead of the content.Designers use lorem ipsum to fill spaces where they want to place content when creat
    ing mockups or draft copies of a final design. Lorem ipsum allows designers to work on a design without waiting for writers to create the actual content. Often, 
    if designers place the actual content in a layout before completing the design, the content might distract the designer or client and draw focus away from the visual
     elements of the project.Since lipsum text is meaningless and it mimics the way content sits in a design, designers also use it to test aspects of the text. This
    may include which font styles, size, color and kerning work best for the content.You can use lorem ipsum as a substitute for content in many print and digital fo
    rmats. Traditionally, the print industry used lorem ipsum in specimen booklets to demonstrate the size and style range of a particular typeface. As the industry pr
    ogressed, it started appearing in transfer sheets and word processors. Now, you can find loremipsumprinted items like pamphlets or brochures, magazines, newspapers
    , letter headings, advertising and packaging. In digital design, lorem ipsum appears in digital marketing, product descriptions, website designs, infographics and
     blog posts.
